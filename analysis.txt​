Run time complexity is Big theta(n^2)
Space complexity is Big Theta(1)

Brute force method is the less convoluted method here since the return needs the locations of the numbers in the unsorted array (and not the numbers that 
added up to target.) If we sort the array to use pointers at each end walking them in, or a binary search then we'd have to go back to the org unsorted array
to find where those numbers were located to return unsorted positions. Which, if you can sort the array faster than n^2 would be "faster" it
doesn't seem very nice. If we just wanted to return a true/false statement, sorting it first would easily win. 

Maybe there are other ways, but it's not obvious to me.
